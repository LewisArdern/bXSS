}

## Details

The following URL ${
  domain.url
} is succeptible to [Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29). XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.

${
  domain.payload
    ? `In this instance, the following payload was utilized: 
\`\`\` 
${domain.payload}
\`\`\`
`
    : ''
}

For more details on the different types of XSS flaws, see: [Types Of XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Types_of_Cross-Site_Scripting)

${
  domain.innerHTML
    ? ''
    : `### HTTP Interaction
The triggered payload was through HTTP interaction, only HTTP headers were captured.`
}

### Domain
${domain.url || domain.openerLocation}

### Host IP
[${domain.victimIP}](https://www.whois.com/whois/${domain.victimIP})

### User Agent
${domain.userAgent}

${
  domain.cookie || domain.openerCookie
    ? `### Cookies
${domain.cookie || domain.openerCookie}`
    : ''
}
            
${
  domain.innerHTML
    ? `### Document Object Model (DOM) Structure
${
        intrusiveLevel === 1
          ? `\`\`\` html
${domain.innerHTML}
\`\`\`
`
          : `The JavaScript utilized was non-intrusve, it only captured HTML elements (nodeName, className, and id) not the entire innerHTML.

${domain.innerHTML}`
      }`
    : ''
}

### Remediation

The general remediation to prevent Cross-Site Scripting is to either output encode, or contextually sanitize user-input before its interpreted by the browser.
